<p>
    Please read this privacy policy ("cookie policy", "policy") carefully before using the
    Exercise Tracking Analytics website ("website", "service", "system") operated by Dash Software Solutions, Inc. ("us", "we", "our").
</p>

<h4>Collection of Personal Information</h4>

<p>
    First Name, Last Name and Email Address are required to create an account and use the service.
    This information is stored only for account and profile management and system usage purposes.
    The system does not currently require nor use a Mobile Phone Number as part of the user account/profile, but may do so in the future.
</p>
<p>
    Using the application requires granting access to information about your athletic activities in
    <a href="https://www.strava.com/" target="_blank">Strava</a>.  This is done by consenting to this access during
    the login/registration process.  Once you grant access, this application will import your data from Strava and
    store it in the application's relational database, in order to be able to query it and provide reporting, analytics and
    insights based on the data.  This data is used by this application under the terms of the
    <a href="https://www.strava.com/legal/api" target="_blank">Strava API Agreement</a>.  You can revoke this application's access to your
    Strava at any time by going to to the "My Apps" area of the Account Settings in Strava.  However, if you do so, you would no longer be
    able to use this application, until you login again and grant access.
</p>
<p>
    None of your personal information used by this application will be shared with any third-party for any purpose
    except as required by U.S. federal or California state law (e.g. responding to a lawfully issued subpeona).

<h4>Email and Mobile Phone (SMS) Communications</h4>

    All communications are for system usage and account management purposes.  No marketing communications are presently sent.
